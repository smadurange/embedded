echo.c program reads a character from the USART
and writes the same character back to USART.

Install GNU screen and run 'screen <device> <baud rate>'
to start communicating with the AVR. For instance, if the
device is ttyACM0 and baud rate 9600, run

screen /dev/ttyACM0 9600

and start typing. You will see the same characters you
type on your terminal.
